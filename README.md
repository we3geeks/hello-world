Nothing to see here; move along...

I'm going to use this repository to learn the basics of using Git and GitHub. Probably not going to be very exciting for anyone to watch, but I figure it is way past time for me to poke around with this. As a long-time Subversion user, Git and GitHub have always been sort of a mystery to me (and still are at this point, really).

I will probably add some files, perhaps a folder or two, poke around a bit with pull requests (which has always seemed a little intimidating to me), and merging.

That is all. (At least, for now.)
